# bikeshare
This repository contains-
1. Three csv files with data for three cities- chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv, washington.csv
2. One python file written to assess the data in the csv files- bikeshare.py

These files are for Python Foundation Nanodegree Program (project for module 1) on Udacity and uses knowledge of numpy and pandas module to make sense of the bike sharing data provided, and answer relevant questions about it.

To use the project-
1. Place the bikeshare.py file and all the CSV files in the same folder.
2. Run the python file using a suitable python interpreter.

To complete the project, I used my knowledge which I gained over the course of studying the Python Foundation Nanodegree Program on Udacity.
